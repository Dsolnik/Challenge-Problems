# Learning-Languages
Follow me as I learn languages through example programs!

The C++ and the project Euler problems folders are just random things I did when learning C++

The Ruby folder is me doing theOdinProject : theodinproject.org

Currently I'm on # 3: Ruby Programming : A Bit of Computer Science
